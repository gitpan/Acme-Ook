This Perl module implements the Ook programming language
as described in  http://bluesorcerer.net/esoteric/ook.html

At least Perl 5.6.0 is recommended but not required, but that's
only because of a bug in Perl 5.00503 that makes the hello.t test
to moan like this:

	t/hello.............untie attempted while 1 inner references still exist at t/hello.t line 7, <OOK> chunk 26.

The test is fine, Perl 5.00503 is not.
